# Reflection
While I couldn't finish the graphics, the WAD reading part is definitely something I'm most proud of. Next time however, I should plan ahead more when it comes to graphics because as it turns out doing it by hand is more difficult than expected. The one thing I didn't follow my proposal was that I attempted to use a rendering algorithm more similar to the original game.
